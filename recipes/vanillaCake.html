    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A simple vanilla cake recipe does what it says on the tin: provides you with a delicate, moist and flavourful cake that can serve as a base
       for something more elaborate, please a host of children clamouring for something sweet or provide a simple sugar fix. This is a cake recipe
       hat works splendidly for birthdays, special occasions, or just that celebrated English ceremony, afternoon tea.</p>
    <p>We also believe that you never need a reason to make or eat a simple vanilla cake, so have it whenever the urge to bake takes you. It’s the
       most basic possible combination of eggs, flour, butter and sugar – practically the Platonic ideal of a cake – baked in the oven for 45-50
       minutes. You’ll know it’s done when it’s golden on top, and a skewer inserted into its side comes out clean.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>margarine or softened butter</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>self-raising flour</li>
        <li>baking powder</li>
        <li>vanilla extract</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180°C. Lightly grease an 18cm (7in) round cake tin with a little extra butter or margarine
            and cut a piece of greaseproof paper or non-stick baking parchment to fit the base of the tin.</li>
        <li>Put all the ingredients into a large mixing bowl and beat with a wooden spoon or a hand-held mixer
            for 1 minute, or until just combined. It's important not to beat the batter too much - just long enough to make it smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour or spoon the mixture into the tin, smooth the top and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for about 45-50 minutes.
            The cake is cooked when it looks well risen and golden; the top should spring back when lightly touched with a fingertip.
            Another test is to insert a skewer into the centre of the cake - it should come out clean.</li>
        <li>Let the cake sit in the tin for 5 minutes, then gently run a knife around the edge and turn it out onto a wire rack to cool. 
            Serve dusted with icing sugar.</li>
    </ol>
