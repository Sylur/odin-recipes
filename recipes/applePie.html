    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An apple pie is a fruit pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apples. The earliest printed recipe is from England. Apple pie is often
       served with whipped cream, ice cream ("apple pie Ã  la mode"), or cheddar cheese. It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below
       the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). The bottom crust may be baked separately ("blind") to prevent it
       from getting soggy.</p>
    <p> Apple pie is an unofficial symbol of the United States and one of its signature comfort foods.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>thinly sliced apples</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>cinnamon</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>butter cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>double pie crust</li>
        <li>egg white + tablespoon water</li>
        <li>granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl add the sliced apples. Sprinkle with the sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt and toss gently to combine well.</li>
        <li>Roll out and place an uncooked pie crust in the bottom of a deep 9-inch pie plate.</li>
        <li>Place the apple mixture in the uncooked pie shell. Place the small pieces of butter on top of apple mixture.</li>
        <li>Top with second pie crust, crimp the edges, and then cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to vent.</li>
        <li>Mix the egg white and 1 tablespoon of water together in a small bowl and then brush the top with water and sprinkle with sugar before baking.</li>
        <li>Bake at 450 degrees F. for the first 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F.  and continue cooking for an additional 40 to 45 minutes, or until the top is golden brown.</li>
        <li>If the edge of the crust starts to brown more quickly than the center, carefully cover the edge with foil for the last 15-20 minutes of baking to prevent over-browning.</li>
        <li>Let the pie cool for 10 minutes before serving. Can be made ahead of time and served at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
